				My research interests are in convex, discrete and combinatorial geometry. A major focus lies on combinatorial problems revolving around lattice points in polyhedra, which are inspired by phenomena in the Euclidean theory of convex bodies. The most basic question of this kind is: Given the volume of a polytope, what can be said about the number of integer points it contains? How do other geometric quantities (such as width or diameter) of the polytope affect the discrepancy of volume and lattice point count? Beyond volume, I studied are further concepts from convex geometry that have interesting and non-trivial discretizations, such as hyperplane sections and projections or equivariant valuations.

				<p>
				Currently, I'm very interested in structural properties of convex bodies that are "extremal" with respect to certain lattice functionals, such as width or covering radius. This line of thought is also inspired by classical geometric ideas such as "bodies of constant width." The goal is to use such structural results to prove tight inequalities on the functionals involved, for instance in the context of the flatness problem in integer linear programming.
