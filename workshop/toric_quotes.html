	"Toric varieties are arguably the simplest and most accessible varieties.
They
often appear in applications, both within mathematics and across the
sciences.
A toric variety is an irreducible variety that is parametrized by a
vector of monomials. The relations among these monomials are binomials,
i.e. polynomials with only two terms. Thus, an irreducible variety is toric
if and only if its prime ideal is generated by binomials. Monomials and
binomials correspond to points in an integer lattice, and we think of these
as the vertices of a lattice polytope. Toric varieties appear prominently in
optimization and statistics, thanks to the purely combinatorial description
given above. This description also makes them a perfect “model organism”
for algebraic geometers. They use toric varieties to test conjectures, teach
geometric concepts, and compute invariants. For instance, the dimension
and degree of a toric variety are the dimension and volume of the associated
lattice polytope." [Michalek, Sturmfels 2021]

	"The study of toric varieties is a wonderful part of algebraic geometry.
There are
elegant theorems and deep connections with polytopes, polyhedra,
combinatorics,
commutative algebra, symplectic geometry, and topology. Toric varieties
also have
unexpected applications in areas as diverse as physics, coding theory,
algebraic
statistics, and geometric modeling. Moreover, as noted by Fulton [105],
“toric
varieties have provided a remarkably fertile testing ground for general
theories.”
At the same time, the concreteness of toric varieties provides an
excellent context
for someone encountering the powerful techniques of modern algebraic geometry
for the first time." [Cox, Little, Schenck 2010]
